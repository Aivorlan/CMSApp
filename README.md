# 12: Employee Management System 
**C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business

## Description
A command-line application that allows the user to add/view/update departments, roles and employess.

## Installation
* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
  
* A variety of SQL JOINS

Bonus points if you're able to:

  * Update employee managers

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
